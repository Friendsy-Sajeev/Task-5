## üîÑ Steps to Capture Traffic

### 2. Start Capturing on Active Network Interface

- Launch Wireshark.
- Select the **active network adapter** (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet).
- Click the **blue shark fin icon** to begin the packet capture.

### 3. Generate Network Traffic

- Open a browser and visit a site, e.g., `https://google.com`
- Or run in terminal:
  '''bash
  ping google.com
  
### 4. Stop the Capture

After 30‚Äì60 seconds, click the red square icon to stop the capture.

### 5. Filter by Protocol

Use the following filters in the top filter bar of Wireshark:

tcp,
http,
dns

### 6. Identify Protocols
Look for at least three different protocols in the capture:
Protocol	Description
TCP	Reliable transport layer protocol
DNS	Resolves hostnames to IP addresses
HTTP/HTTPS	Web traffic (unencrypted/encrypted)
ICMP	Used for pings (echo requests/replies)

### 7. Save as .pcap or .pcapng
Go to File ‚Üí Save As

Name your file, e.g., capture.pcap

Choose .pcap or .pcapng as format

### Output Example
Example file: capture.pcapng
